      description: The​ IQSS portal for cloud-based research computing​ ​(​link​) aims to make it easy for researchers to make a seamless transition from doing the calculations on their laptop to using cloud-based computing resources. It provides level 3 security data storage, which is essential in the social sciences where private personal data is extensively used.
      role: ​For this project,Ianalyzedtheusageofthecurrentresearchcomputingclusterto determine types of use and which applications were used. I then used this to determine the steps needed to transfer the current users to the new Sid environment. Currently, I am helping researchers to transition to the new environment and I do usability tests on the first version of the new environment to propose future improvements. I am also working with the project manager and board to develop a long-term roadmap.
      enjoy: What I enjoy most​ in this project is interacting directly with the scientists and learning what is needed to improve the product further, brainstorm about future development, prioritize the future steps to be taken. I also enjoy looking for collaborations with other universities to be more efficient in the services we can offer. For this I visited the supercomputing conference SC19 in Denver, Co in November 2019.

    - name: Metrics Dashboard for IQSS website
      description: ​The ​homepage of IQSS​ contains a section with metrics of the institute and the department. The current version of the metrics pages involves a lot of manual labor and lacks visual unity. The numbers and graphs are all static and often only available in PDF format. The goal is to make the metrics dynamic and automated.
      role: In cooperation with the directors, choose a platform and implement a (semi) automated dashboard on the website.
      enjoy: What I enjoy most​ is the hands-on approach. Up to now it was hard to make progress on this project. I have chosen to develop the dashboard (intitially) in R Shiny that makes fast development possible. I also like to collaborate with the directors to define the metrics that are suitable for a broader audience but can also easily be obtained and automated.

      description: The​ ​Automated History Archive​ l​ ed by Prof. dr. M. Dell (Economics Dept.) is a Harvard initiative to automate the conversion of image scans of historical quantitative publications into classified, machine-readable data models so these numbers can be used in further research. Machine learning algorithms and a web portal for data curation and research are developed.
      role: ​I​ actasaninterfacebetweenthecontractorandtheIQSSDataverseteam,which is the team responsible for the open-source research data repository and associated software.
      enjoy: What I enjoy most​ in this project is the interaction with an offshore contractor, which requires telecons and an efficient kind of communication and interaction. I also feel that this project is very valuable and useful as the challenges we encounter when digitizing documents are related to recognizing structure in page layout. This is something that has not been solved yet in commercial optical character recognition software and is necessary for many digitization projects with many applications.
