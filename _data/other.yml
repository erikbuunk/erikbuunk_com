    work with a team to accomplish concrete
    results. With my open and analytical mind, I
    can understand complex issues quickly. By
    my enthusiastic manner of presenting, by
    listening, I can mediate, advise people, and
    if needed convince them. Values I consider
    important are honesty, freedom and good
    relationships with colleagues.
